 - Removed the _CAF* variables from Rearm-VMs and moved the rearm snippet to the common folder.
   ActiveRearm-VM is now completely separated from Caffeine
 - Added the Caffeine directory to version control. The Common folder is subject to separate version control
   and as such is not included in the Caffeine repository.

 - Added more extensive support for symbolic links to the [Install] section of Hive.ini files.
   In the old implementation the syntax was:
		symlink=<PathToSymlink>
   which would create a symbolic link at PathToSymlink which pointed to the volume.
   
   In the new imlementation the syntax is:
		symlink=<PathToSymlink>[<Separator><TargetOfSymlink>]
   which lets us specify a symlink pointing to an arbitrary location (e.g. a file or folder in the hive).
   Valid Separators are any characters that cannot appear in a valid filesystem path (|:<>*?"). If the
   TargetOfSymlink is omitted the old behavior is used and the generated symlink will point to the hive.

 - Added a full installation of DISM 10.0.14393.0 to the Common directory under bin\, so
   as not to rely on the local dism (which may vary from instllation to installation).

 - Added support for the MountPoint declaration to the [Install] section. This will cause Install-HiveDisk
   to add a mountpoint for the hive-vhd volume, e.g.:
	MountPoint=C:\VMs\MyCourse
   
   However, for Hyper-V items like VHDs and Virtual Machine Files to use a mountpoint when resolving interal paths (e.g. parent paths)
   it must be the 'first' mountpoint for the volume. By contrast, the paths for any filesystem items we retrieve (e.g. with Get-item, Get-VHD)
   will reflect the path we used to retrieve it, with no way to find the canonical path for the item.

   Normally if the volume has been assigned a drive letter, then the first mountpoint would be '[DriveLetter]:\', so the drive
   letter must be removed if we want Hyper-V to use the custom mountpoint.

   So the MountPoint directive is not compatible with the DriveLetter directive, and adding a MountPoint directive will cause
   any driveletter set by the  DriveLetter directive to be removed.

   MountPoint directives are always handled after any DriveLetter directives, and so will always override them.

 - To support the MountPoint functionality, a function was added to retrieve the Paths to a given volume 'Find-VolumePath'.
   Where possible when handling volumes, scripts should use a Find-VolumePath to determine how a volume should be accessed,
   rather than using driveletters.
